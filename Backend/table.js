The introduction of new Characters both good and bad also makes the movie more exciting. giving the characters more of a back story can also help audiences relate more to different characters better, and it connects a bond between the audience and actors or characters. Having seen the movie three times does not bother me here as it is as thrilling and exciting every time I am watching it. In other words, the movie is by far better than previous movies (and I do love everything Marvel), the plotting is splendid (they really do out do themselves in each film, there are no problems watching it more than once."]);

// THE GOOD:

// First off the action in this movie is amazing, to buildings crumbling, to evil blue eyed robots tearing stuff up, this movie has the action perfectly handled. And with that action comes visuals. The visuals are really good, even though you can see clearly where they are through the movie, but that doesn't detract from the experience. While all the CGI glory is taking place, there are lovable characters that are in the mix. First off the original characters, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, are just as brilliant as they are always. And Joss Whedon fixed my main problem in the first Avengers by putting in more Hawkeye and him more fleshed out. Then there is the new Avengers, Quicksilver, Scarletwich, and Vision, they are pretty cool in my opinion. Vision in particular is pretty amazing in all his scenes.

// THE BAD:

// The beginning of the film it's fine until towards the second act and there is when it starts to feel a little rushed. Also I do feel like there are scenes missing but there was talk of an extended version on Blu-Ray so that's cool.`]);

The world is indeed an infinitely more complex place than the world of Marvel comics with clearly identifiable heroes and villains. But I get the feeling that from Robert Downey, Jr. on down the organizer and prime mover as Iron Man behind the Avengers these players do love doing these roles because it's a lot of fun. If they didn't show that spirit of fun to the audience than these films would never be made.

// So in that spirit of fun Avengers: Age Of Ultron comes before us and everyone looks like they're having a good time saving the world. A computer program got loose and took form in this dimension named Ultron and James Spader who is completely unrecognizable is running amuck in the earth. No doubt Star Trek fans took notice that this guy's mission is to cleanse the earth much like that old earth probe NOMAD which got its programming mixed up in that classic Star Trek prime story. Wouldst Captain James T. Kirk of the Enterprise had a crew like Downey has at his command.

// My favorite is always Chris Evans because of the whole cast he best gets into the spirit of being a superhero. Of all of them, he's already played two superheroes, Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. I'll be before he's done Evans will play a couple of more as long as the money's good and he enjoys it.

Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system.

He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton's house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury (Samuel L.

// "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is an entertaining adventure with impressive special effects and cast. The storyline might be better, since most of the characters do not show any chemistry. However, it is worthwhile watching this film since the amazing special effects are not possible to be described in words. Why Pietro has to die is also not possible to be explained.

The two-time National awardee helms one of India's preeminent production houses, Excel Entertainment, a brand name aptly synonymous with excellence and success. The banner made its foray into the industry with Dil Chahta Hai (2001), a trailblazing film that not only bagged the National Award in 2001 by the President Of India but also acquired cult status amongst the millennial viewers as a forerunner of new age cinema.

// On the one hand, Excel's oeuvre comprises a string of box-office hits like Dil Chahta Hai (2001) , Don (2006) , Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011) , Talaash: The Answer Lies Within (2012) & Fukrey (2013) . Alongside these blockbusters, Excel has also launched avant-garde ventures like Gully Boy (2019) , India's first hip hop film and the official entry to the Academy Awards this year and Inside Edge (2017) , India's first original series on Amazon Prime Video that was nominated for the coveted International Emmy Awards under the Best Drama category in 2018. In addition to commercially successful cinema, Excel has consistently garnered critical acclaim, Rock On being one such accomplishment that won the production house its second National Award in 2008.

// For Ritesh Sidhwani, the name behind the banner, success is not about being alone on the top but is about empowering others to reach there. As such, he has been instrumental in providing an open platform to debutant directors and filmmakers to exhibit their original work. This open and accessible approach has ensured that Excel stands as a hallmark for refreshingly novel content and cutting-edge global film making techniques, which have placed Indian cinema on the international map as a force to reckon with.

// From an entrepreneur who was a film aficionado to becoming one of India's most successful filmmakers with a panache for state-of-the-art cinema, Ritesh Sidhwani's journey has been as dramatic as his fast-paced action thrillers. He took a leap of faith, incorporating his entrepreneurial skills and business acumen coupled with his passion for good cinema by establishing Excel Entertainment Private Limited in partnership with his longtime friend and confidante, Farhan Akhtar.

// Excel aims at continuing its dream run as a production house. To that end, the banner produces feature films and has started distributing it theatricality worldwide apart from creating original content for digital platforms.

// Cinema is life with 'cuts' and Excel hopes to make the right ones to create cinema that will be remembered through the annals of revolutionary filmmaking.`,"1973","No info"])
